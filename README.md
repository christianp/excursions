Every now and then an idea occurs to me or I see a puzzle or something, and I write a little bit of code to explore it.
I have code spread all over the place in flat files and github gists and so on, so I thought it would be a good idea to collect it all in one place.
I also realised it would help me in the long run to write down what I'm doing, so I'm going to try to explain my thought process at the top of each project.
